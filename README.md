# ELEC-509-Final-Project-MID-Diff
This goal of this project is to propose a novel method for fast medical image-to-image (I2I) synthesis.<br>
So far, I've accomplished the following tasks: (1) performed I2I synthesis using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM)<br>
and (2) evaluated the performance of BBDM under different parameters initializations. 

**Abstract:**

```
I present a novel method for Medical Image Synthesis using Distilled Diff usion Models
(MID-Diff). MID-Diff uses progressive distillation and denoising diffusion probabilistic
models (DDPM) for fast high quality medical image-to-image (I2I) translation. In this
paper, I discuss current state-of-art methods for medical I2I translation. I then discuss their
limitations and review methods for improving I2I translation quality and efficiency. Finally,
I review my plans for implementing MID-Diff and validating its efficacy. If validated on
larger sample size, MID-Diff has the potential to improve disease diagnosis and treatment
planning in low-resource clinical settings
