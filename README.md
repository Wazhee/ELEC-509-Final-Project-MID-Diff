# ELEC-509-Final-Project-MID-Diff
This goal of this project is to propose a novel method for fast medical image-to-image (I2I) synthesis.<br>
So far, I've accomplished the following tasks: (1) performed I2I synthesis using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM)<br>
and (2) evaluated the performance of BBDM under different parameters initializations.
